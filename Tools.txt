AI Tools used for this project:

1. Windsurf 

( For the initial stages of the project including creation and 
UI designing and functionality improvements)

        Pros:
            - Stunning VSCode based Editor with inbuilt agent that can
            do it all for you
            - Great work on the UI and functionality thanks to advanced, latest
            models
            - Free 100 tokens for new users
            - Does every task in a to-do manner which is very systematic
        
        Cons:
            - Debugging an issue is still a very hard thing
            - Had a very hard time fixing the alignments of the containers.
            - Unneccesarily changes other files and stuff which is a big drawback
            in most of the AI models currently present maybe due to lack of proper
            memory storage features

2. Github Copilt 

( Claude Sonnet v3.5 was used for further improving the outputs from
Windsurf )

        Pros:
            - One of the most stable choices in the marketplace for making changes 
            on existing code in VSCode
            - Helped fix the UI and functionality a lot

        Cons:
            - The thinking and working speed of the AI is very slow
            and its not very dependable ( but the thing is it was not so 
            slow or inefficient before with the same model)
            - No access to best models right now like Claude Sonnet v4.0

3. Claude by Anthropic

( Used for fixing the UI completely and revamping the existing styles.css
which helped in finishing off the web-app development).

        Pros:
            - One of the best free models in the world right now which can give
            the best code compared to other free tools.
            - The output is pinpoint accurate without much errors and even if any
            its easily fixable
        
        Cons:
            - The models are free only for a very limited quota
            - The newly introducted 5-hour limit is even more exhausting
