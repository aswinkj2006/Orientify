- “Prompt This Into Existence!” Hackathon Challenge Description: 
As an AI-first developer, use any AI software development tool, AI 
prompting and AI prompting techniques, develop a one page mobile-friendly 
web application that detect how a user is holding their mobile device and 
displays the following features: ● Portrait Mode (Upright Orientation) – 
Alarm Clock ● Landscape Mode (Right-Side Up Orientation) – Stopwatch ● Portrait 
Mode (Upside Down Orientation) – Timer ● Landscape Mode (Right-Side Up Orientation)
 – Weather of the Day. Display the weather of the day using a weather api 
 (free tier). Key Requirements: ● Mobile-first design (responsive, touch-friendly).
 ● Seamless orientation transitions. ● Must run entirely in the browser 
 (no native apps) ● Should be compatible on Android and iOS devices

make the best submission for this. i want the best in terms of ui. 
make the styling based on the "Liquid Glass" design of Apple.

(Initial Prompt included giving all the context and stating the needed 
requirements for the web-app which resulted in an 85% satisfactory result)

make the following changes

- make the entire website work like a mobile app. make the app title as 
orientify in some cool logo fonts and then show the apps according to orientation
try to have a very fluid smooth transition when switching orientation such 
that it should make the user think that same box just shapeshifted to this.
for the alarm clock, go full in on the app and make it look like the ios alarm
clock app where the time is shown and multiple alarms can be added by clicking
on add button and clear button should remove all existing alarms and each alarm
has an on or off toggle which can be set and the days can be chosen and an alert 
and on screen popup will be shown with snooze and turn off and if snooze is 
pressed repeat the alarm. the snooze gap can be input by the user in the 
specific alarm card along with the days to repeat and others. if not set the 
normal snooze gap is 5 minutes. so make it a fully fledged alarm app with all 
features and add more if possible. for weather the app is saying getting location 
but its not doing so, rather try fetching the location by asking for permission 
and accessing data from browser. make this location show up as one card saying 
current location and the user can add more cards for each places he wants and he 
can delete them also by swiping it or clicking delete button. for each card 
fetch the weather of the entered location. make it a fully fledged weather app 
but dont use the api too much as there are limits just use api for fetching the 
weather in celsius or farenheit and the user has option to change between both 
units. for the timer app in my laptop i see it like this idk if in mobile it will 
be different because i cant test that orientation as mobiles dont have that 
orientation but it is upside down so if thats an error fix it and make it a fully 
fledged timer app like in ios with multiple timers and ability to turn them on or 
off. and when multiple timers are on show countdown for each. for the stopwatch 
app make it a fully fledged stopwatch app. make the buttons not just texts with 
circular highlights and border color but like a glass box with white gradient 
shadows inside and black shadows outside making it look like a liquid glass 
object with text in it making the button pop out from the website. do the same 
for the boxes containing the alarm/stopwatch/timer/weather app. and the background 
seems to show some whites while changing orientation make the purple canvas larger 
so there are no bound limits causing white parts to show when changing orientation

( this detailed prompt was provided inorder to correct all issues but didnt prove 
really effective as AI had a hard time doing all this so it started skipping
something in each response )

- new works to be done
    *remove the icons near app title
    *make sure every button works, coz add new location, add alarm, 
        clear all for timer and all doesnt work.
    *the app name is nowhere to be seen 
    *every timer is created for 5 mins whereas the time should be given by 
        the user get it in format HH:MM:SS and use it to create timer

( further refining the functionality and ui of the app through detailed prompting )

- look at the first picture make the size smaller according to screen size and 
make sure everything fits in screen and nothing is overlapped. use a unique font 
for Orientify and make it appear just above the alarm box and not at topmost.
make sure alarm pop up comes only once when alarm occurs and use snooze and turn 
off as options. for timer see the picture uploaded flip the entire timer box and 
make the timer show up in hh:mm:ss format only dont add up the hours to minutes 
and the timer is not working when start is clicked. 

( this is where debugging started and everything started messing up )

- revert the changes
- this is not how it was please fix and test it and make sure 
everything is working like all buttons and all are organized and 
fitting inside screen without overlaps may it mean reduction in size

( with these prompts i tried to bring back the old UI as the entire UI got
changed from a functional superb one to a bad one )

- see this image and fix this no api key and the functions not being there in 
js for delete and edit for alarm and there is no toggle to turn on and off 
alarm and place the icons in image i.e div class alarm-controls. below the alarm 
and days text.
-in this snooze should be taken from user with deafult as 5 mins. 
the toggle should turn the alarm on or off and edit button can edit all the 
details and delete button can delete the alarm 
-deleteAlarm() and editAlarm() and toggleAlarm() these functions are not 
working because when i click nothing is happening. and also
-div current-time is not real time its just static makeit real time 
-now nothing is here orientations are not being shown
-nothing is being displayed debug and fix it

( tried to bring back the old ui and its functionality but the further prompts
just resulted in more mess ups of the existing ui )

2. Claude 

-i have an orientation based app changing program. i want this to look better 
and work far better because rn its absolute bs. the css is mainly fucked functionality 
is great. ill upload the index html and styles.css keep the design intact but change 
the positioning such that its mobile-ready and touch-ready and when in potrait mode 
or potrait-secondary mode the app title is just above the liquid glass box and the 
liquid glass box is there. and in landscape or landscape-secondary the text should 
be on left and the liquid glass box on right and the liquid glass box must be smaller 
than itis now to fit the contents and not go out of bounds and make it scrollable if 
required. the stopwatch looks great already but the app header on left side must be on 
center and the stopwatch glass box must be smaller and the lap times box shouldnt 
conflict with the stopwatch control buttons so make the ui fantastic and to the point 
with no such issues just clean ordered structured perfect UI. if any further queries 
or file is needed make sure to ask me before proceeding

( fixing of ui by prompting the exact details and structuring a question answer reasoning based prompt )

-1. all 4 components must be there and it should only appear when the phone is in a 
    specific position like if phone is in 0 or 360 degrees or portrait then it 
    should be alarm if the phone is in 90degrees or -270 degrees or landscape then it should be 
    stopwatch. if its in 180 degrees or -180 degrees or portrait upside down then it should be 
    timer and if its in 270 degrees or -90 degrees or landscape upside down it should be weather app.
2. i want both centered in a side by side layout like the app header should be in left 
    center of screen and glass box centered in right side.
3. id prefer individual containers scrolling but if there is a place where entire 
    app scrolling would be better then do that.
4. yes then keep that
5. make it mobile first design and if the degree is 0 but the screen width is more 
    than height then its laptop so then use desktop layouts but else then keep mobile 
    first itis
6. responsive would be best if possible

( further answering the questions to get the best required satisfactory result from the AI )

( ui turned out great but there was a clock ui width issue which was self fixed and claude's quota had been exhausted )

3. Github Copilot

- In this when the timer is started the countdown doesnt show its just stuck on the set time and not counting to 0

( the timer functionality was broken and copilot managed to fix it well and create no other errors )

- in the timer app the timer cant be set for just seconds because then itd automatically set 5 if input is given 
as 0 minutes fix that

( specifying the issue thoroughly to get proper satisfactory fixes that doesnt result in churn )

- the weather is not working the add location feature is not working it always says cant get weather for the location
- change the weather function completely from openweatherapi to weatherapi.com
- change this also according to the script.js. if this file is not needed then remove it
- make the weather cards in weather glass box scrollable

( the following prompts were provided to first analyze error with existing weather api and to further change it
and cleanup the code and add scrolling to make the ui feasible to the user )
